NBA simulator - work in progress

description:
Program currently capable of simulating a game between the Celtics and Warriors (missing the outcome)

(player stats from ESPN 2022)
(feel free to use/modify/contribute to this code as you see fit!)

Major Limitations:
- no substitutions (only 5 man rotation)(no plans to address this)
- inputing team/player data is tedius (definetely want to address this)
- game exists outside of the scope of time (not sure if I want to/can fix this)

Minor Limitations:
- no injury mechanic (no plans to address this)
- turnovers are impossible after offensive rebounds (not sure if I want to fix this)



issues to fix:
[!]  fix the run play function
    - rework the shoot function to return an array of passer and shooter?
[!]  fix rebounding stats
[!]  fix looping shots after miss
[!]  keep track of team points
[!]  print final scores and winner
[ ]  fix the way player/team data is inputted
[!]  add documentation
[!]  reset player stats after each game



Things to add
[ ]  make a .txt file for inputting team info
[ ]  more options for "dialogue"

! == completed
