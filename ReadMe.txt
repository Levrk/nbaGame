NBA simulator - work in progress

description:
Program currently capable of simulating a game between a select group of NBA teams
(team options: cavs, celtics, warriors, nuggets, bucks, nets, heat, suns, hawks)

HOW TO USE: just run "java Main celtics warriors" in the command line to watch them play
(or use >> filename to save the play-by-play)

(player stats from ESPN 2022)
(feel free to use/modify/contribute to this code as you see fit!)

Major Limitations:
- no substitutions (only 5 man rotation)(no plans to address this)
- inputing team/player data is tedius (definetely want to address this)
- game exists outside of the scope of time (not sure if I want to/can fix this)

Minor Limitations:
- no injury mechanic (no plans to address this)
- turnovers are impossible after offensive rebounds (not sure if I want to fix this because it would make TOV% innacurate)
- stats may be inflated based on limited rotation



Teams to add:
[ ]  add pelicans roster
[ ]  add grizzlies roster
[ ]  add 76ers roster
[ ]  add mavs roster
[ ]  add timberwolves roster

Issues to fix:
[!]  add extra quarters in case of tie game
[!]  too many rebounds
[!]  fix rebounding stats
[!]  fix looping shots after miss
[!]  keep track of team points
[!]  print final scores and winner
[!]  fix the way player/team data is inputted
[!]  add documentation
[!]  reset player stats after each game


Things I could add
[ ]  make a .txt file for inputting team info
[ ]  more options for "dialogue"
[ ]  create a game overview using game stats

! == completed
